# Marble-Tilt

Roll Marbles into set positions on screen

Paul Hudson Hacking with Swift - project 26

Took most of the code and created my own spin on it.

First, I changed all the walls to silver balls (multiple balls on screen, I can collide with vortex but i cant create a collision with vortex (freeze ball over vortex)

Second, several Vortex become a Smiley Face Picture

Third, Player is red ball that can freeze ball over vortex and create new player.

Items im working on, finish - when all vortex are covered game is over, new level/picture gesture recognizer shake - when user shakes ipad marbles will unfreeze from vortex and free move again new levels/pictures

size of picture (reduce size of marble and screen so more complex pictures can be created. more marbles
