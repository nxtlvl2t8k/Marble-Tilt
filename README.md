First, I changed all the walls to silver balls (multiple balls on screen, I can collide with vortex but i cant create a collision with vortex (freeze ball over vortex)

Second, several Vortex become a Smiley Face Picture

Third, Player is red ball that can freeze ball over vortex and create new player.

Items im working on,
finish - when all vortex are covered game is over, new level/picture 
gesture recognizer shake - when user shakes ipad marbles will unfreeze from vortex and free move again 
new levels/pictures 
size of picture (reduce size of marble and screen so more complex pictures can be created. more marbles

Stretch goal
